## 🗣️ Speech-to-Text Transcription Service

This project demonstrates how to build a **speech-to-text transcription pipeline** using Python and modern deep learning libraries. It is intended for transcription services such as audio interviews, podcasts, or voice notes.

### 🚀 Features

* Automatic speech recognition (ASR) using models from Hugging Face and OpenAI Whisper
* Audio pre-processing with `librosa` and `noisereduce`
* Simple interface for uploading and transcribing audio files
* Designed for use in Google Colab

### 📦 Dependencies

Install the necessary packages with:

```bash
pip install kaggle
pip install transformers torchaudio librosa noisereduce
pip install openai-whisper
pip install datasets
```

### 📁 Dataset

The project supports uploading `.tar.gz` files, potentially from Kaggle. You can upload your own dataset in Google Colab using:

```python
from google.colab import files
files.upload()
```

### 🧠 Models Used

* **Hugging Face Transformers** for model loading and inference
* **OpenAI Whisper** for robust speech recognition (optional)

### 🛠️ Usage

1. Upload your audio files or dataset archive
2. Run the preprocessing and model inference cells
3. View the transcribed text

### 📍 Notes

* This notebook is intended for educational purposes and prototyping.
* Some large models may require GPU acceleration (e.g., using Google Colab Pro).
